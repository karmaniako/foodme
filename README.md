# FoodMe App â€” a workshop app built with AngularJS

Simplified meal ordering app for local restaurants built with AngularJS
and node.js backend.

Complete rewrite for modern node and angular! I will add more later.

---

The app is build on top of [angular-seed](http://github.com/angular/angular-seed),
check out seed's README to understand what the scripts under `scripts/` are doing.
